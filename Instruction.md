- **Use comprehensive code comments** for all development work
- **Follow Laravel best practices** and conventions
- **Maintain dark theme consistency** across all UI components
- **Implement security measures** from the start, not as an afterthought
- **Complete each task fully** before marking it as done in the Task List

5. Don't hardcode configurations
6. Don't skip error handling
7. Don't ignore performance from the start
8. Don't mark tasks complete prematurely

### **14.3 Quality Standards**
- Every function must have a comment explaining its purpose
